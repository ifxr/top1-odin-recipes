        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> French fries are the perfect go to snack for all situations. </p>

        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong> Potatoes </strong> </li>
            <li> <strong> Salt </strong> </li>
            <li> <strong> Ketchup</strong> </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Step-By-Step </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. (A French Fry Cutter makes this easier.) </li>
            <li> Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight. (Longer = crispier fries)</li>
            <li> Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.</li>
            <li> Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes. Don't overcrowd them by 
                placing too many in at a time, they won't be as crispy. Use a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel.</li>
            <li> Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. <strong> Serve with ketchup! </strong></li>
        </ol>
